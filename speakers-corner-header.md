# Speakers' Corner

Named after the renowned corner of Hyde Park in London, the Speakers' Corner seminars are a platform for everyone who would like to share their research. 
Do you have a new preprint and want to create an accompanying video lecture or just a cool result you would like to share with the community? 
Speakers' Corner allows you to create, advertise, and share your talk via Virtual Science Forum's platform.

### Give a talk
The series is hence on a "self-invitation" basis, where you register for giving a talk through the [Registration Form](https://github.com/virtualscienceforum/virtualscienceforum/issues/new?template=speakers_corner_application.md) and bring your own audience. 
Every week, an announcement email is sent to the Speakers' Corner mailing list (register [here](mailinglist.md)) containing all of the upcoming talks. 
That way, more potential participants will learn about your talk and may decide to join.

### How it works

1. Pick the topic of your talk, the date and time (must be at least two weeks in the future), and make sure all your co-authors know about your presentation and agree.
2. Fill and submit the [Registration Form](https://github.com/virtualscienceforum/virtualscienceforum/issues/new?template=speakers_corner_application.md).
  - You should have a [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) account associated with the email address you provide.
3. VSF then 
  - checks availability of your date and time slot, and then creates the Zoom meeting
  - sends you the host key and a registration link
  - announces your talk in the VSF Speakers' Corner mailing list and on this website.
4. Make sure you advertise your talk and invite participants to register for it.
5. You are welcome to moderate your talk yourself as well as to invite a colleague to be your moderator.
6. VSF automatically records your talk, forwards the file to you afterwards, and then publishes it on our dedicated [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvQEx4iW7u_x3jX742kUZLw)
